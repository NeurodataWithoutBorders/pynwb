NWB Format API
==============

PyNWB is a Python package for working with NWB files. It provides a high-level API for
efficiently working with Neurodata stored in the `NWB format <https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io>`_.

`Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB:N) <http://www.nwb.org/>`_ is a project to develop a
unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, focused on the
dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental
conditions.

The NWB:N team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
who recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward
breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience.
