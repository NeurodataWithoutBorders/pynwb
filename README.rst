Readme
------------
To contribute to PyNWB, you must submit your changes to ``dev`` branch via a `Pull Request <https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request>`_.

From your local copy directory, use the following comands.

1) First create a new branch to work on

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git checkout -b <new_branch>

2) Make your changes.

3) Push your feature branch to origin (i.e. github)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git push origin <new_branch>

4) Once you have tested and finalized your changes, create a pull request to dev.

   - **When creating the pull request, please check the box to close the branch after your pull request is merged if you do not intend to do any more development on that branch.**
