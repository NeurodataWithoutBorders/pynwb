  doc: Stores pixels in an image that represent different regions of interest (ROIs)

    storage for multiple imaging planes (masks) supported. Each ROI is stored in its
    own subgroup, with the ROI group containing both a 2D mask and a list of pixels
    that make up this mask. Segments can also be used for masking neuropil. If segmentation
    is allowed to change with time, a new imaging plane (or module) is required and
    ROI names should remain consistent between them.
