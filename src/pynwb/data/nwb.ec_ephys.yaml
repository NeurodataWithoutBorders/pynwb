    Ideally, the waveform analysis should be performed on data that is only high-pass

    For example, IMEC probes may require different storage requirements to store/display
    mean waveforms, requiring a new interface or an extension of this one.

    FilteredEphys modules publish an ElectricalSeries for each filtered channel or

    informative. The source of the filtered data, whether this is from analysis of
    another time series or as acquired by hardware, should be noted in each's TimeSeries::description
    field. There is no assumed 1::1 correspondence between filtered ephys signals
    and electrodes, as a single signal can apply to many nearby electrodes, and one
    electrode may have different filtered (e.g., theta and/or gamma) signals represented.
