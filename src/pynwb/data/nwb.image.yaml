  doc: Stores indices to image frames stored in an ImageSeries. The purpose of the
    ImageIndexSeries is to allow a static image stack to be stored somewhere, and
    the images in the stack to be referenced out-of-order. This can be for the display
    of individual images, or of movie segments (as a movie is simply a series of images).
    The data field stores the index of the frame in the referenced ImageSeries, and
    the timestamps array indicates when that image was displayed.
