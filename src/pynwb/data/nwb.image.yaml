    times it will be stored as an external image file in the host file system. The
    data field will either be binary data or empty. [frame][y][x] or [frame][z][y][x].

  doc: Image data that is presented or recorded. A stimulus template movie will be

    is required, such as field of view (e.g., how much of the visual field the image
    covers, or how what is the area of the target being imaged). If the OpticalSeries
    represents acquired imaging data, orientation is also important.

- neurodata_type_def: IndexSeries
  neurodata_type_inc: TimeSeries
  doc: Stores indices to image frames stored in an ImageSeries. The purpose of the
    ImageIndexSeries is to allow a static image stack to be stored somewhere, and
    the images in the stack to be referenced out-of-order. This can be for the display
    of individual images, or of movie segments (as a movie is simply a series of images).
    The data field stores the index of the frame in the referenced ImageSeries, and
    the timestamps array indicates when that image was displayed.
