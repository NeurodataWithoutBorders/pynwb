  doc: 'Intrinsic signal optical imaging or widefield imaging for measuring retinotopy.
    Stores orthogonal maps (e.g., altitude/azimuth; radius/theta) of responses to
    specific stimuli and a combined polarity map from which to identify visual areas.<br
    />Note: for data consistency, all images and arrays are stored in the format [row][column]
    and [row, col], which equates to [y][x]. Field of view and dimension arrays may
    appear backward (i.e., y before x).'
