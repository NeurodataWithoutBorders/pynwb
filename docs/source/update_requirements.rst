How to Update Requirements Files
================================

The different requirements files introduced in :ref:`software_process` section are the following:

* requirements.txt_
* requirements-dev.txt_
* requirements-doc.txt_

.. _requirements.txt: https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/blob/dev/requirements.txt
.. _requirements-dev.txt: https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/blob/dev/requirements-dev.txt
.. _requirements-doc.txt: https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/blob/dev/requirements-doc.txt

requirements.txt
================

`Requirements.txt` of the project can be created or updated and then captured using
the following script:

.. code::

   mkvirtualenv pynwb-requirements

   cd pynwb
   pip install .
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

   deactivate
   rmvirtualenv pynwb-requirements


requirements-(dev|doc).txt
==========================

Any of these requirements files can be updated updated using
the following scripts:

.. code::

   cd pynwb

   # Set the requirements file to update
   target_requirements=requirements-dev.txt

   mkvirtualenv pynwb-requirements

   # Install updated requirements
   pip install -U -r $target_requirements

   # If relevant, you could pip install new requirements now
   # pip install -U <name-of-new-requirement>

   # Update list of pinned requirements
   pip freeze > $target_requirements

   deactivate
   rmvirtualenv pynwb-requirements

Note: If you create requirements files using Python 2.x, you should manually remove any entries for the `enum34` package before committing. This package is only required for versions of Python < 3.4, and should not be installed in later versions. Since our requirements files are shared across Python 2 and 3 we instead rely on `pip` to install this package only when it is required. (See `issue #677 <https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb/issues/677>`_ for discussion.)
