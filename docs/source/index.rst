NWB for Python
==============

PyNWB is a Python package for working with NWB files. It provides a high-level API for
efficiently working with neurodata stored in the NWB format. If you are new to NWB
and would like to learn more, then please also visit the :nwb_overview:`NWB Overview <>`
website, which provides an entry point for researchers and developers interested in using NWB.

`Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) <https://www.nwb.org/>`_ is a project to develop a
unified data format for cellular-based neurophysiology data, focused on the
dynamics of groups of neurons measured under a large range of experimental
conditions.

The NWB team consists of neuroscientists and software developers
who recognize that adoption of a unified data format is an important step toward
breaking down the barriers to data sharing in neuroscience.
