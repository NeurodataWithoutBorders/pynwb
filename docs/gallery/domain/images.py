Storing Image Data in NWB
==========================

This tutorial will demonstrate the usage of the :py:mod:`pynwb.image` module for adding
images to an :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile`.

Image data can be a collection of individual images or movie segments (as a movie is simply a series of images),
about the subject, the environment, the presented stimuli, or other parts
related to the experiment. This tutorial focuses in particular on the usage of:

* :py:class:`~pynwb.image.OpticalSeries` for series of images that were presented as stimulus
* :py:class:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries`, for series of images (movie segments);
* :py:class:`~pynwb.image.GrayscaleImage`, :py:class:`~pynwb.image.RGBImage`,
  :py:class:`~pynwb.image.RGBAImage`, for static images;

The following examples will reference variables that may not be defined within the block they are used in. For
clarity, we define them here:

# OpticalSeries: Storing series of images as stimuli
# --------------------------------------------------
#
# :py:class:`~pynwb.image.OpticalSeries` is for time series of images that were presented
# to the subject as stimuli.
# We will create an :py:class:`~pynwb.image.OpticalSeries` object with the name
# ``"StimulusPresentation"`` representing what images were shown to the subject and at what times.
#
# Image data can be stored either in the HDF5 file or as an external image file.
# For this tutorial, we will use fake image data with shape of ``('time', 'x', 'y', 'RGB') = (200, 50, 50, 3)``.
# As in all :py:class:`~pynwb.base.TimeSeries`, the first dimension is time.
# The second and third dimensions represent x and y.
# The fourth dimension represents the RGB value (length of 3) for color images.
#
# NWB differentiates between acquired data and data that was presented as stimulus.
# We can add it to the :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile` object as stimulus data using
# the :py:meth:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile.add_stimulus` method.

# External Files
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# External files (e.g. video files of the behaving animal) can be added to the :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile`
# by creating an :py:class:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries` object using the
# :py:attr:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries.external_file` attribute that specifies
# the path to the external file(s) on disk.
# The file(s) path must be relative to the path of the NWB file.
# Either ``external_file`` or ``data`` must be specified, but not both.
#
# If the sampling rate is constant, use :py:attr:`~pynwb.base.TimeSeries.rate` and
# :py:attr:`~pynwb.base.TimeSeries.starting_time` to specify time.
# For irregularly sampled recordings, use :py:attr:`~pynwb.base.TimeSeries.timestamps` to specify time for each sample
# image.
#
# Each external image may contain one or more consecutive frames of the full :py:class:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries`.
# The :py:attr:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries.starting_frame` attribute serves as an index to indicate which frame
# each file contains.
# For example, if the ``external_file`` dataset has three paths to files and the first and the second file have 2
# frames, and the third file has 3 frames, then this attribute will have values `[0, 2, 4]`.

# Static images
# -------------
#
# Static images can be stored in an :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile` object by creating an

#          :py:class:`~pynwb.image.GrayscaleImage` provide the optional: 1) ``description`` parameter to include a
#          text description about the image and 2) ``resolution`` parameter to specify the *pixels / cm* resolution
#          of the image.
#
# RGBAImage: for color images with transparency
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# :py:class:`~pynwb.image.RGBAImage` is for storing data of color image with transparency.
# ``RGBAImage.data`` must be 3D where the first and second dimensions
# represent x and y. The third dimension has length 4 and represents the RGBA value.

# IndexSeries for repeated images
# -------------------------------
#
# You may want to set up a time series of images where some images are repeated many
# times. You could create an :py:class:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries` that repeats the data
# each time the image is shown, but that would be inefficient, because it would store
# the same data multiple times. A better solution would be to store the unique images
# once and reference those images. This is how :py:class:`~pynwb.image.IndexSeries`
# works. First, create an :py:class:`~pynwb.base.Images` container with the order of
# images defined using an :py:class:`~pynwb.base.ImageReferences`. Then create an
# :py:class:`~pynwb.image.IndexSeries` that indexes into the
# :py:class:`~pynwb.base.Images`.

# :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile` object.

# with the name of the :py:class:`~pynwb.image.ImageSeries` object "ImageSeries".
#
# We can also access :py:class:`~pynwb.image.OpticalSeries` data that was added to the NWB File
# as stimuli by indexing ``nwbfile.stimulus`` with the name of the :py:class:`~pynwb.image.OpticalSeries`
# object "StimulusPresentation".
# Data arrays are read passively from the file.
# Accessing the ``data`` attribute of the :py:class:`~pynwb.image.OpticalSeries` object
# does not read the data values into memory, but returns an HDF5 object that can be indexed to read data.
# Use the ``[:]`` operator to read the entire data array into memory.
