Exploratory data analysis with NWB
==================================

This example will focus on the basics of working with an :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile` to do more than
storing standardized data for use and exchange. For example, you may want to store results from intermediate
analyses or one-off analyses with unknown utility. This functionality is primarily accomplished with linking
and scratch space.


.. note::
    The scratch space is explicitly for non-standardized data that is not intended for reuse
    by others. Standard NWB:N types, and extension if required, should always be used for any data that you
    intend to share. As such, published data should not include scratch data and a user should be able
    to ignore any data stored in scratch to use a file.

# Copying an NWB file
# -------------------
#
# To copy a file, we must first read the file.

# And then create a shallow copy the file with the :py:func:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile.copy` method
# of :py:class:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile` .

nwb_proc = nwb_in.copy()

#
# Now that we have a copy, lets process some data, and add the results as a :py:class:`~pynwb.base.ProcessingModule`
# to our copy of the file. [#]_

# Now write the copy, which contains the processed data. [#]_

#    .. note::
#       Notice here that we are reusing the timestamps to the original TimeSeries.
#
# .. [#]
#    .. note::
#       The ``processed_data.nwb`` file (i.e., our copy) stores our processing module and contains external
#       links to all data in our original file, i.e., the data from our raw file is being linked to, not copied.
#       This allows us to isolate our processing data in a separate file while still allowing us to access the
#       raw data from our ``processed_data.nwb`` file, without having to duplicate the data.

#
# Adding scratch data
# -------------------
#
# You may end up wanting to store results from some one-off analysis, and writing an extension
# to get your data into an NWBFile is too much over head. This is facilitated by the scratch space
# in NWB:N. [#]_
#
# First, lets read our processed data and then make a copy

# the results for.

# Finally, write the results.

# To get your results back, you can index into :py:attr:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile.scratch` or use
# :py:func:`~pynwb.file.NWBFile.get_scratch`:

# .. [#]
#    .. note::
#       This scratch space only exists if you add scratch data.
#
# .. [#]
#    .. note::
#       We recommend writing scratch data into copies of files only. This will make it easier to
#       isolate and discard scratch data and avoids updating files that store precious data.
