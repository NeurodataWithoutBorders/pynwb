Object IDs in NWB
=================

This example focuses on how to access object IDs from NWB container objects and NWB container objects by
object ID. Every NWB container object has an object ID that is a UUID_ string, such as
"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000". These IDs have a non-zero probability of being duplicated, but are practically
unique and used widely across computing platforms as if they are unique.

The object ID of an NWB container object can be accessed using the
:py:attr:`~hdmf.container.AbstractContainer.object_id` method.

#    It is important to note that the object ID is NOT a unique hash of the data. If the contents of an NWB container
#    change, the object ID remains the same.
