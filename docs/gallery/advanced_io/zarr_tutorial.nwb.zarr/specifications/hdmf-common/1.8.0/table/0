These datasets represent different columns in the table. Apart from a column that contains unique identifiers for each row, there are no other required datasets. Users are free to add any number of custom VectorData objects (columns) here. DynamicTable also supports ragged array columns, where each element can be of a different size. To add a ragged array column, use a VectorIndex type to index the corresponding VectorData type. See documentation for VectorData and VectorIndex for more details. Unlike a compound data type, which is analogous to storing an array-of-structs, a DynamicTable can be thought of as a struct-of-arrays. This provides an alternative structure to choose from when optimizing storage for anticipated access patterns. Additionally, this type provides a way of creating a table without having to define a compound type up front. Although this convenience may be attractive, users should think carefully about how data will be accessed. DynamicTable is more appropriate for column-centric access, whereas a dataset with a compound type would be more appropriate for row-centric access. Finally, data size should also be taken into account.
